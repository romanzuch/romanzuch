### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a engineer and developer based in Berlin.

- ðŸ’¬ I'm always looking for ways to colaborate with other developers
- âš¡ Deeply interested in all things code: iOS development, machine learning, web development
- ðŸ“« 2021 Goal: Build my own YouTube and/or Twitch Channel
- ðŸ˜„ Creating projects powered by SwiftUI

## SwiftUI

- currently cloning the Grover app and building some smaller projects
- and re-writing some older projects in SwiftUI including apps that show you random quotes of a former US president

## Medium

- I just published my first article on medium about the usage of open data and SwiftUI &rarr; [How I have used open data and SwiftUI to explore Covid in Berlin](https://roman-zuchowski.medium.com/how-i-have-used-open-data-and-swiftui-to-explore-covid-in-berlin-1c9b162b5e23)
