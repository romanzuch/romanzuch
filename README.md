### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Roman and I am a mechanical engineer based in â›° Munich, Germany. I am currently working on improving my Python skills and obtaining knowledge in Swift development and web development. 

As I sometimes lack motivation to code on my own, I am always looking for a coding buddy. Participating in an open source project would also be great - I am always searching for *easy* first issues. 

I love using code to solve my little everyday challenges.
